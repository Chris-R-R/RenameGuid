# RenameGuid
Tool to rename files to GUIDs. Useful for flattening a directory hierarchy

Example usage:
Downloading a site with a web spider and then wanting to copy the pictures to a flat directory.
Searching in Explorer after *.jpg and then copying these files to a new folder will likely give you name collisions.
Running this tool first will help with this problem.

# ToDo

* Unicode support
* Allow user to choose extension on the command line
* Perform the copy to the desired directory instead of doing this manually
